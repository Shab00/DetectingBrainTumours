- **Background Subtraction:** Technique that allows extraction of an image's foreground for further processing.
- **Edge Maximization:** Process of identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image.
- **Foreground Detection:** Task in computer vision and image processing to detect changes in image sequences.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model:** Probabilistic model for representing normally distributed subpopulations within a population.
- **Image Segmentation:** Process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments.
- **Kernel:** Small matrix used in image processing for blurring, sharpening, etc.
- **Point Spread Function:** Describes the response of an imaging system to a point source or object.
- **Thresholding:** Technique for partitioning an image into foreground and background.
- **UI:** Means by which the user and a computer system interact.
